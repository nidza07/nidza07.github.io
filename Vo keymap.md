For anybody curious, my VoiceOver gestures map is like this:
Gesture|Action|Comment
1 finger triple tap|escape|This is basically the scrub gesture by default
One finger quadruple tap|Long press|None
Two finger double tap|Magic tap|None
2 finger triple tap|Toggle audio ducking|One of the most useful gestures. As soon as something too loud starts up, two finger triple tap helps. Not assigned to anything by default.
Two finger quadruple tap|Open quick settings|I find myself never using this. Will probably be changed to something more useful.
Three finger single tap|Read item summary|Also never used in practice.
Three finger double tap|Toggle mute|In reality, this toggles speech on and off. The command VoiceOver actually calls toggle speech pauses and resumes speaking a given text string.
Three finger triple tap|Toggle screen curtain|none
Three finger quadruple tap|Copy speech to clipboard|none
Four finger single tap|Unchanged|I would love to assign this to something, but doing that used to break the commands to tap with 4 fingers near the top or bottom to move to the first or last item, and the only way to fix them again was to completely reset your commands, so I am not messing with this.
Four finger double tap|Copy|None
Four finger triple tap|Open VoiceOver settings|None
Four finger quadruple tap|Paste|None
Two finger swipe up|Scroll down|I prefer the way we scroll on Android, with 2 instead of 3 fingers, so to avoid pasting all of them, all my two finger swipes scroll in appropriate directions.
Three finger swipe up|Move to previous link|Extremely useful Web navigation commands follow.
Three finger swipe down|Move to next link|None
Three finger swipe left|Move to previous heading|None
Three finger swipe right|Move to next heading|None
Four finger swipe up|Scroll to top|This command scrolls to the top of any list.
Four finger swipe down|Scroll to bottom|Much more useful than the previous one. Scrolling to the top can be achieved by double tapping the status bar, but scrolling to the bottom of a long list is sometimes not easily doable. This unassigned command by default helps with that.
Four finger swipe left|Switch to previous app|None
Four finger swipe right|Switch to next app|None
