Nikola\'s corner of the web

# Welcome

 Here, you can find everything I am passionate about. Software, games, music, and a lot more...

## Audiogames
### Audiogame guides, tips, cheats and tricks
Are you looking for a good place to find guides, walkthroughs, tips, cheats, tricks or save files for your favorite audiogame?  
Look no further! Here, you will find a central repository.  
[Open the audiogame guides homepage](/ag-guides/index.html)
Would you like to make a contribution by submitting your own content? Do it via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nidza07/ag-guides).  
You want to contribute but don't have any idea what GitHub is or how to use it? Don't worry, this will definitely be possible in the near future, as soon as I figure out the most efficient way to do that... Until I do, if you know where to contact me, feel free to send your contributions.



### Quentin C's Playroom

[Quentin C's Playroom](https://qcsalon.net) is a gaming platform, free
and accessible to the blind, for playing card, board and dice games.\
As a fan of the platform, I've made an [unofficial
documentation](QC-docs/general-usage). There is still work to be done,
but it should be more than enough to help you get started, and
understand most of the features the platform has to offer.

Contributions to the documentation are more than welcome, either
directly via Git (if you know how), or simply by getting in touch and
suggesting improvements.
