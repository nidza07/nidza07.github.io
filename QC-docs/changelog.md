# Playroom documentation changelog
Note: The items below are considered the internal changelog. This means that the changes below have been written even before the first version of this documentation was published anywhere at all, so they are much less detailed, personal notes I have used for myself. Future changes will be much more accurate and precise.

## October 10th, 2023:
### General usage:
- Fixed TOC nested lists.
- Even more final preparations for the first version.
- Added a note on opening the friends list or the forum from anywhere with a shortcut.
- Explained that a table master can replay the same stream by leaving the link in the dialog and pressing enter.
- Added a quick summary of the most important rules to  follow.
- Unless major problems are found, the general usage document is considered finished and ready for any future updates.

### Web client
- Started the Web client documentation. A lot missing...

### Website:
- Started the website documentation. Even more missing... Currently mostly a placeholder.

## October 9th, 2023:
### General usage:
- Remove the  section "A note about forum updates", since there is no more client forum cache.

## October 8th, 2023:
### General usage

## October 6th, 2023:
### General usage
- Added the explanation for the WASAPI/direct sound option under the audio options chapter.
- Mentioned that the inbox can be opened with ctrl+shift+M in the your inbox subsection of the additional features chapter.
- Added the Markdown documentation in the further documents chapter, and credited the Playroom staff for that one in the credits. Switched the links to point to the Playroom website rather than copying those documents here to avoid outdated copies.
