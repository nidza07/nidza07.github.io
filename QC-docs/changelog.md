# Playroom documentation changelog
Note: The items below are considered the internal changelog. This means that the changes below have been written even before the first version of this documentation was published anywhere at all, so they are much less detailed, personal notes I have used for myself. Future changes will be much more accurate and precise.

## October 22nd, 2023:
### Web client:
- We actually started this work yesterday but never documented it, the OS specific known issues. Today further work was done on this section. Need inspiration...

### General usage:
