## Introduction
The Playroom website, located at https://qcsalon.net allows you to do many useful things. Change your account settings such as your password, e-mail address or your nickname, view your game statistics or statistics of other people, create forum polls, and, if you are adventurous enough, even enable beta test features! These options will be described here.

## Website layout
Once you open the home page, the first thing you should do is login with your account, so you have access to every feature described here. If you are logged out, you can still  browse the website, read the forum, access some statistics, and, of course, if necessary, create your account or reset the password, in case you forgot it. The sections not available when you are logged out will  be marked with a + (plus) sign.

The website will give you a menu of some of the most important functions. The play link will allow you to open the web client directly. If you are not logged in, and activate it, you will first be asked to login. Keep in mind that for the web client to connect successfully, when login in, the remember me checkbox must be checked. You can logout once  you are done playing, if this is not your computer. You also have a link to your account settings, described in the [Account options](#account-options) section, as well as the link to log out.

The main menu will let you browse the forum, read the statistics, or perform a search (currently disabled).
